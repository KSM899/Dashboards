```

## Deployment Considerations

For production deployment:

1. Build the optimized production bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Configure environment variables for:
   - API endpoints
   - Authentication services
   - Performance monitoring

3. Implement proper HTTPS and security headers

4. Consider implementing a CDN for static assets

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- Backend 
- Advanced data forecasting and predictive analytics
- Integration with CRM and ERP systems
- Mobile app version with push notifications
- Customizable dashboard layouts with drag-and-drop
- Expanded report builder with scheduling options
